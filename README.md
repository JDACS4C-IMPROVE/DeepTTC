# DeepTTC
DeepTTC: a transformer-based model for predicting cancer drug response

Identification of new lead molecules for treatment  of cancer is often the result of more than a decade of dedicated efforts. Before these painstakingly selected drug candidates are used in clinic , their anti-cancer activity was generally varified by vitro cell experiments. Therefore, accurately prediction  cancer drug response is the key and challenging task in anti-cancer drugs design and precision medicine. 

DeepTTC is an end-to-end deep learning model to predict the anti-cancer drug response. DeepTTC takes gene expression data and chemical strcutures  of drug for drug response prediction. Specifically, get inspiration from natural language processing, DeepTTC use  transformer for drug representation learning.
